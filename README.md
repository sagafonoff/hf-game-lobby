## Challenge Description

The Hello Fresh Game Lobby is planned to be a web application that lets players from around the world come to play the "Game of the Day" for fun.

The game that is available changes daily. The game that is played is not offered through the game lobby. Third party game makers provide the gaming platform.

To start a game, the players are connected to the remote game servers and a game window loads in the browser.

On completion of the game, the game stats are reported back to the hello fresh game lobby and displayed to the player.

## Requirements

As we are in the first stages of development, our goal is to build the beginning structure to be developed on at a later stage. Initially, we are aiming to build only the following:

1. Load the game of the day when the application starts up and displays the game name in a prominent location
2. A button that will allow a player to connect to a game
3. A game zone area that will display when a game connection is in progress and will display "Finding game"
4. When a game is found for the player the game zone area displays "Game in progress"
5. When no game can be found the game zone area displays "Unable to find a game"
